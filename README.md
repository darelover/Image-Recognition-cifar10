# Image-Recognition-cifar10

This is a Keras implementation to recognise images from cifar10 dataset using Convolutional Neural Networks. The model in this notebook achieves 93% accuracy on training set and 83% accuracy on validation set using Dropout and Batch Normalization techniques.

## Todo:
- [ ] Use data augmentation
- [ ] Model is overfitting, therefore, apply regularisation
